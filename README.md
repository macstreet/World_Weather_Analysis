# World Weather Analysis
## Module 6 Challenge Overview
In this challenge, we gathered weather data from cities of random latitudes and longitudes, performing a API call with OpenWeatherMap. Then, we pulled info on travel preferences, gathered nearest hotels to those cities, and plotted those cities on a map. Finally, we created an itinerary of four cities to travel to in Austrailia. We used the Geoapify Routing API to create the itinerary, showing the route between the four cities, and then created a map showing each city with routes.
